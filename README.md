This  C# code for a class called "BasicMath" that contains methods to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The "add" method takes two double parameters, "a" and "b", and returns their sum.

The "subtract" method takes two double parameters, "a" and "b", and returns their difference.

The "divide" method takes two double parameters, "a" and "b", and returns their quotient. It first checks if "b" is equal to zero, and if so, throws a "DivideByZeroException" with the message "Cannot divide by zero".

The "multiply" method takes two double parameters, "a" and "b", and returns their product.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of common mathematical operations in C#.# testing
